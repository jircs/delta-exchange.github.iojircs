# All Markets Card Area Config

- Order of the cards is defined by their position within this file. 
- Currently there are two files for Devnet ( devnet.json ) and Production ( prod.json ) 
- Always make changes on devnet first and verify those are working fine, then only paste same changes on production.
- After editing the file always copy the entire contents of the file and paste [here](https://jsonformatter.org/ "here") then click on Validate. A popup should show up on top right stating "Valid JSON". If it shows any error then the JSON structure is not correct.
